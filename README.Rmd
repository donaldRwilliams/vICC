# vICC: Varying Intraclass Correlation Coefficients

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/donaldRwilliams/BGGM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/donaldRwilliams/BGGM)

The goal of vICC is to compute varying intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) in a one-way random
effects model (i.e., a random intercepts only model). Often computing an ICC is the first step
when fitting a mixed-effects (a.k.a., hierarchical, multilevel, etc.) model that results in *merely* 
one value that is assumed to apply to each group (e.g., person, school, etc.). The underlying assumption
is a common within-group variance, whereas, in **vICC**, a random-effects model is fitted to 
the residual variance, thereby permitting group-level ICCs. When subjects are the grouping variable, this 
is akin to investigating individual differences.


## Measurement Reliability
The methodology in **vICC** was introduced in @williams2019putting. The context was 
measurement reliability in a cognitive inhibition task. To this end, **vICC** provides 
ICC(1), that is the correlation for any two observations from the same group, and ICC(2), 
that is average score reliability. Both ICC(1) and ICC(2) are reliability indices. 

## Available Models

The following are implemented in **vICC**:

1. `pick_group`: 
    
    This model has a spike and slab on the random intercepts 
    for the within-group variance.  This provides posterior inclusion 
    probabilities that each group (e.g., person) does not belong to the 
    common within-group variance model.
                 


## Installation

You can install the released version of vICC from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("vICC")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("donaldRwilliams/vICC")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(vICC)
## basic example code
```
